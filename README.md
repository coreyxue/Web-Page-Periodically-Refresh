Web-Page-Periodically-Refresh
=============================

Using Selenium Webdriver to refresh a web page periodically.

This is my first time learn to use Selenium Webdrive, not for the purpose of testing but simply try to simulate some human interaction with the browser.

To setup Selenium Webdriver

1 Firefox required

2 Install ruby from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en

3 Install gem, run:
  gem install selenium-webdriver

4 install Selenium IDE
  Open http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/2.4.0/selenium-ide-2.4.0.xpi within firefox
